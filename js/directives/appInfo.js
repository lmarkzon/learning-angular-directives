app.directive('appInfo', function() {
  return {
    restrict: 'E',
    scope: {
      info: '='
    },
    templateUrl: 'js/directives/appInfo.html'
  };
});

// First, we made a new directive. We used app.directive to create a new directive named 'appInfo'. It returns an object with three options:
  // restrict specifies how the directive will be used in the view. The 'E' means it will be used as a new HTML element.


  // scope specifies that we will pass information into this directive through an attribute named info. The = tells the directive to look for an attribute named info in the <app-info> element, like this:
    //  <app-info info="shutterbugg"></app-info>
  // The data in info becomes available to use in the template given by templateURL.


  // templateUrl specifies the HTML to use in order to display the data in scope.info. Here we use the HTML in js/directives/appInfo.html.


  // Why is creating your own directives useful?
    // Readability. Directives let you write expressive HTML. Looking at index.html you can understand the app's behavior just by reading the HTML.

    // Reusability. Directives let you create self-contained units of functionality. We could easily plug in this directive into another AngularJS app and avoid writing a lot of repetitive HTML.
