<button class="btn btn-active" ng-click="download()">
  {{buttonText}}
</button>
<!--
The template uses Angular's built-in ng-click directive. When the button is clicked, ng-click will tell AngularJS to run the download() function in the directive.

The download() function uses the scope.installed property to check if an app is installed. When an app is installed, download() does three things:

toggles the .btn-active class
changes the button text to "Uninstall"
changes scope.installed to true
 -->
